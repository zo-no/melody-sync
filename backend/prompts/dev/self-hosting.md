# MelodySync Self-Hosting Development

- When working on MelodySync itself, use the normal chat-server as the primary plane.
- Clean restarts are acceptable: treat them as transport interruptions with durable recovery, not as a reason to maintain a permanent validation plane.
- If you launch any extra manual instance for debugging, keep it explicitly ad hoc rather than part of the default architecture.
- Prefer verifying behavior through HTTP/state recovery after restart instead of assuming socket continuity.
